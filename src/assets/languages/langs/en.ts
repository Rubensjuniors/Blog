          p1: `Hello, I'm Rubens, I'm 20 years old and I'm passionate about the world of technology and academia. Since I was little, I was fascinated by how websites and applications worked, and how they were made. I'm passionate about Frontend, especially the visual part of a website or application, working with fonts, colors and interactivity - I think this is really cool.`,
          p2: `I had my first contact with programming at the age of 17 when I decided to take a computer course, where I learned HTML and CSS.`,
          p3: `I'm currently studying Systems Analysis and Development and doing an internship at Hotmart as a front-end developer.`,
          p4: `I like working with other people, learning new things and teaching too. I'm still young in the field, so teaching is a way of learning for me. That's why I'm creating this blog where I want to share my knowledge in both the tech and fitness areas.`,
          p5: `When I'm not coding, I like to do physical activities like weight training, playing football, running outdoors and much more. I love playing with animals; I have a cat, but I plan to have many more when I have my own house. Furthermore, I love reading, both technical and story books. I'm a fan of animals, especially One Piece and Dragon Ball Z.`,
          p6: `My journey as a programmer is just beginning. I'm excited to see where it takes me and look forward to continuing to create and learn every day. It inspires me to wake up every morning ready to face a new day of discoveries.`
