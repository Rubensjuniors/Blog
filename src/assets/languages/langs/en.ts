        text: `Hello, my name is Rubens and I am a young man passionate about technology and programming. I'm 19 years old and recently decided to dedicate myself to studying programming with the aim of becoming a front-end developer. I believe this area perfectly matches my interests and talents, and I am excited to learn and grow in this area. Although I'm still at the beginning of my journey as a programmer, I've already managed to accomplish some things with the little knowledge I've acquired. I believe that, with a lot of effort and dedication, I will evolve every day and achieve my goals as a front-end developer.`
